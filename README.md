## Project Summary


## Files and Folders
- *[data_scraping.ipynb](data_scraping.ipynb)*
    Contains code for scraping data from billboard rankings,
    Genius API and Spotify API.
- *[plot_cosine_heatmap.R](plot_cosine_heatmap.R)*
    Contains code for plotting a heatmap for cosine similarity.
    Obtained from
    [here](https://github.com/UMCUGenetics/MutationalPatterns/blob/master/R/plot_cosine_heatmap.R)
- *[Project 3 Exploration.Rmd](Project-3-Exploration.Rmd)*
    Code for exploration data for the project.
    Graphs statistics for data as well.
- *[Project-3-Numeric-Features.Rmd](Project-3-Numeric-Features.Rmd)*
    Code for exploration of numeric features. Linear Regression, K-Means, DBSCAN
    and Random Forest models were tested.
- *[Project-3-Words-Features.Rmd](Project-3-Words-Features.Rmd)*
    Code for exploration of words(lyric) features. K-Means and cosine similarity
    models were tested.
- *[Project-3-Combined.Rmd](Project-3-Combined.Rmd)*
    Code for exploration of numeric features + words(lyric) features.
    Cosine similarity model was tested.

## Obtaining data
- Data can be obtained from the Google Drive Folder
    [http://bit.ly/data-mining-project-3-data](http://bit.ly/data-mining-project-3-data)
- Data can also be downloaded from *[data_scraping.ipynb](data_scraping.ipynb)*.
    However, we preprocessed through many steps manually in order to get the data
    as the data obtained from websites wasn't always in the best format. Further,
    it would require downloading a lot of packages and often debugging parts of
    selenium.
